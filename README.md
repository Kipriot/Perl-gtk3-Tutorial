Perl-gtk3-Tutorial
==================

A basic introduction to using the Gtk3 toolkit with the Perl bindings. This tutorial was written to help my son and I learn Gtk3/Perl. The tutorial takes a series of standard widgets and presents them with a full, working example and an explanation of how it works.

We are posting this on the internet in case other people find it useful.
